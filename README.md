Details of this Challenge  

QHardware is a tutorial series based on quantum hardware resources for example superconducting qubits, trapped ion quantum computer etc. This education material is a combination of jupyter notebooks, quizzes, assignments etc. The resources contain step by step procedures to learn quantum hardware design, tools to design quantum processor like qiskit-metal, KQCircuits, SCQubits etc. The learners will know about step by step processes of how hardware qubits are made. Similarities and differences between traditional processors and quantum processors are also covered.
