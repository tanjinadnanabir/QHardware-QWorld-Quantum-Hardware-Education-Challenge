Name of the Challenge: Quantum Hardware Education Challenge by QWorld  

Title of the Project: QHardware- Learn Quantum Hardware Design with Superconducting Qubits  

Details of this Challenge  

QHardware is a tutorial series based on quantum hardware resources for instance superconducting qubits, trapped ion quantum computer etc. This education material is a combination of lectures, slides, jupyter notebooks, quizzes, assignments etc. The resources contain step by step procedures to learn quantum hardware design and tools to design quantum processor like qiskit-metal. The learners will get knowledge on step by step processes of how hardware qubits are made. Similarities and differences between traditional processors and quantum processors are also covered.
